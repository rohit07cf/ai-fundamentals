# AI Engineer Interview Prep

> Your "night before the interview" companion.
> This repo is built for one thing: making you **dangerous** in AI/ML interviews.
> No fluff, no textbook walls, no "proof left as exercise."
> Just clear intuition, sharp answers, and the confidence that comes from actually understanding the material.
> Let's get you hired.

## How to Revise This in < 30 Minutes

You're short on time. Here's the plan:

1. **Start with the topic README** (e.g., `linear_regression/README.md`) — read the 60-second pitch out loud.
2. **Skim the intuition file** (`00_intuition_and_geometry.md`) — refresh the "why," not the "how."
3. **Jump to the Q&A file** (`06_interview_qna.md`) — practice answering 5 random questions out loud.
4. **Glance at the diagrams** — one picture is worth a thousand equations.
5. **Review one code example** — remind yourself what this looks like in practice.
6. **Done.** Go crush it.
